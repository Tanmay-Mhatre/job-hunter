/**
 * How much of each hiring system's companies the directory holds, measured three ways:
 *
 * 1. Estimate (Chao2) from how often our URL sources agree: a lower bound, because they all draw
 *    on the same crawls.
 * 2. Independent sample: companies picked from Wikidata (not from any URL list) and resolved from
 *    their own websites. The share of their boards the URL sources already had is the coverage
 *    figure the 90% target is measured on.
 * 3. Hold-one-out: how many live boards only one URL source lists (what we'd lose without it).
