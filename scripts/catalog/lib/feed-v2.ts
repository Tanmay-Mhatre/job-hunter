/**
 * The job feed's second format (packages/core/src/job-feed-diff.ts): a full copy plus a change file per
 * day, so apps that are up to date download only what changed. Written next to the first format while
 * apps move over.
 *
 * In <out>: jobs-v2-snapshot-<seq>.json.br (full copy), jobs-v2-diff-<seq>.json.br (today's changes),
 * jobs-v2-manifest.json (upload it last). Yesterday's snapshot and manifest must be in <out> (the feed's
 * saved state) for a change file to be made; without them, apps download the full copy once.
