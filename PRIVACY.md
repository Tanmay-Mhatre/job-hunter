# Privacy

Job Hunter runs on your computer. Your profile, resume and searches stay there. This page lists
everything the app sends over the network, and to whom.

## What stays on your computer

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Your profile: roles, places, topics, companies | `jobhunter.config.local.yaml` (or `jobhunter.config.yaml`), gitignored |
| Your resume | `profile/resume.md`, gitignored |
| Telegram bot token and chat id | `profile/secrets.json` (gitignored), or the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` environment variables |
| Run history, jobs found, scan results | `data/`, gitignored |
| Statuses, notes, saved and applied jobs | your browser's storage (export them in Settings for a backup) |

Scoring and filtering happen on your computer. Nothing above is uploaded by the app.

## What the app sends, and to whom

### Company job boards
Scans fetch public job postings straight from each company's hiring system (Greenhouse, Lever,
Workday and others). These requests come from your computer, so those sites see your IP address,
like any website you visit. The app identifies itself with a Job Hunter User-Agent. It never sends
your profile or resume to them, and never touches apply forms.

### Public job boards you add
If you add Hacker News "Who is hiring", Remotive, Arbeitnow or Remote OK, the app reads their free
public APIs from your computer (Hacker News through Algolia's HN API), at most a few times a day.
Nothing about you is sent; those sites see your IP address, like any website you visit.

### The shared company directory
The app downloads the company directory and job index (`manifest.json`, `directory.json.gz`,
`index.json.gz`) and the daily job feed (`jobs-manifest.json` and its shards, from the `jobs` release)
from GitHub Releases of `Tanmay-Mhatre/job-hunter-directory`. GitHub sees your IP address, as with
any download. Everyone downloads the same files, and your filters are applied on your computer, so
nothing about you is uploaded and the downloads don't reveal what you're looking for.

### Sharing companies you add (on by default)
When you add a company by its careers link, and it isn't in the directory yet, the app sends that
board to the project's contribution inbox, so everyone can find it. This is **on by default**.

What is sent:
- the hiring system and the board name (for example `lever` and `acme`), plus the Workday
  shard and site, or the EU region, when needed;
- the company's name;
- the app name (`job-hunter`), optionally with a version number.

Never sent: your profile, resume, searches, statuses, notes, or which jobs you open.

The inbox is a small Cloudflare Worker (`services/contribute`). What it does with a request:
- **Your IP address** is used only by Cloudflare's rate limiter (20 requests a minute per address).
  The Worker doesn't store it, and we haven't turned on Cloudflare's request logs. Cloudflare
  itself handles the traffic under its own privacy policy.
- **It stores** the boards, the time they arrived, and the `client` field only if it is exactly the
  app name and version (like `job-hunter/0.1.0`); anything else in that field is dropped. Any
  other field in the request is ignored.
- **It also keeps** a list of the boards accepted each day (no IP, no time beyond the date) for 8
  days, to skip repeats and enforce a daily limit.
- Stored boards are deleted once the directory workflow has processed them, and after 30 days at
  most.

Boards that pass a live check are then published in `contributions.json` in the public directory
repo, as a hiring system, a board name and a company name. They aren't linked to you.

### Telegram alerts (only if you set them up)
Alerts are sent through Telegram's API (`api.telegram.org`) with your own bot. They contain job
titles, companies and links.

### No telemetry
The app has no analytics, no crash reporting and no usage tracking. The web dashboard loads no
outside scripts or fonts.

## Turning sharing off

Either:
- **Settings → Your data → Sharing**: switch off "Share companies I add by link with everyone"; or
- in your config file:

  ```yaml
  directory:
    share_additions: false
  ```

Boards already waiting to be sent (`data/catalog/outbox.json`, shown in the directory bar as
"waiting to be shared") can still be sent at the next directory update. Delete that file to
drop them.

## Your company in the directory

If you run a company and want it removed from the published directory, see
[Takedown and opt-out](https://github.com/Tanmay-Mhatre/job-hunter-directory/blob/main/NOTICE.md#takedown-and-opt-out).
