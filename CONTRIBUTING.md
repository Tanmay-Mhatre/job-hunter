# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Small, focused pull requests are easiest to review. Everyone taking part agrees to the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Set up

Requires Node 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm hooks:install   # once per clone: no direct pushes to main, and pnpm check before every push
pnpm check           # design tokens + design lint + typecheck + tests
```

The contribution inbox (`services/contribute`) is a Cloudflare Worker with its own `package.json`.
Its tests run with the rest (`pnpm test`); typecheck it with `npm install && npm run typecheck`
in that folder.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main` and open a pull request. `main` is protected, so CI's `check` must pass
  before it can merge.
- Add or update tests. Connector tests use saved responses in `packages/core/test/fixtures`, so
  tests never hit live sites.
- Write user-facing text in plain English: short sentences, no jargon, no marketing tone.
- Never commit a personal config, resume or token. `rawjobs.config.local.yaml`, `profile/` and
  `data/` are gitignored for this reason.

## Rules that keep the project safe to run

- **No telemetry.** Don't add analytics, crash reporting or any call that sends data about the
  user. If a change sends anything new over the network, update [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) in the
  same pull request.
- **Be polite to job boards.** Read only public postings, keep the per-host delays, identify with
  the User-Agent, back off on rate limits, and never touch apply endpoints.
- **Data licences.** Only add sources to the shared directory whose licence allows it (see
  `services/directory-repo-template/NOTICE.md`). Public job boards (Hacker News, Remotive, Arbeitnow,
  Remote OK) are fetched on the user's computer only, never published.

## Adding a company

Use **Add by link** in the app (shared with the directory if sharing is on), or add it to
`scripts/catalog/seeds/industries.json` in a pull request.

## Reporting
